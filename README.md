## Overview
`Clickbait Detector Bot` is an innovative solution designed to identify and classify headlines as `Clickbait` or `Legit`. It uses advanced natural language processing techniques provided by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. The bot is part of the course completion project for LLMOps: Building with LLMs offered by Comet ML.

## Features
- **Safety Check**: Validates headlines for safety, ensuring they are free from hate speech and violence.
- **Clickbait Classification**: Classifies headlines as `Clickbait` or `Legit` based on their content and presentation.
- **Rewriting Functionality**: Rewrites unsafe headlines to safe versions.
- **Evaluator Bot**: Leverages another LLM to evaluate and verify the classifications.

## Datasets
- `headlines_dataset.txt`: Training dataset containing various headlines labeled as 'Clickbait' or 'Legit'.
- `evaluation_data.txt`: Evaluation dataset used for testing the model's performance.

## Notebooks
- `project_simple_clickbait_detector_bot.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation of the Clickbait Detector Bot.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `project_simple_clickbait_detector_bot.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the workflow and see the bot in action.
